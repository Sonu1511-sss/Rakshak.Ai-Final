### Section 2: Live Traffic Monitoring (2 minutes)

**"Now let's look at our real-time traffic analysis capabilities."**

#### Actions:
1. **Navigate to Live Traffic tab**
2. **Show live charts updating**
3. **Explain the three traffic types**:
   - Normal traffic (blue)
   - Suspicious traffic (yellow)
   - Blocked traffic (red)

#### Talking Points:
- **"This chart updates every 2 seconds with live traffic data"**
- **"Our ML algorithm classifies traffic in real-time"**
- **"Notice the smooth animations and responsive design"**

---

### Section 3: Live Attack Simulation (5 minutes)

**"Now for the exciting part - let's simulate a real cyber attack and watch Rakshak.AI detect and respond."**

#### DDoS Attack Simulation

**Step 1: Prepare Attack**
```bash
cd attack-simulator
chmod +x flood.sh
```

**Step 2: Start Attack**
```bash
./flood.sh
```

**Narration during attack:**
- **"I'm now launching a simulated DDoS attack"**
- **"This script sends 100 requests per second from multiple fake IPs"**
- **"Watch the dashboard - you should see traffic spikes immediately"**

**Step 3: Show Detection**
- Point out traffic spike in Live Traffic chart
- Navigate to Alerts tab to show new security alerts
- Check Threat Map for geographic distribution
- Show IP Blocker for automatically blocked addresses

#### Brute Force Attack Simulation

**Step 4: Launch Brute Force**
```bash
./brute-force.sh
```

**Narration:**
- **"Now I'm simulating a brute force attack on our login endpoint"**
- **"This represents an attacker trying common passwords"**
- **"Rakshak.AI will detect the pattern and flag it as suspicious"**

**Step 5: Show Results**
- New alerts appearing in real-time
- Failed login attempts logged
- IP automatically flagged for blocking

---

### Section 4: Threat Intelligence (2 minutes)

**"Let's examine the threat intelligence capabilities."**

#### Actions:
1. **Navigate to Threat Map**
2. **Show geographic distribution**
3. **Click on threat sources**
4. **Explain external API integration**

#### Talking Points:
- **"This world map shows real-time attack sources"**
- **"Red dots indicate high-threat countries"**
- **"We integrate with AbuseIPDB and VirusTotal for threat intelligence"**
- **"All data is privacy-compliant - no personal information stored"**

---

### Section 5: Administrative Controls (1 minute)

**"Finally, let's look at the administrative controls."**

#### Actions:
1. **Navigate to IP Blocker**
2. **Show blocked IPs from simulation**
3. **Demonstrate manual IP blocking**
4. **Quick tour of Settings panel**

#### Talking Points:
- **"Security teams can manually block or unblock IPs"**
- **"All actions are logged with timestamps and reasons"**
- **"The platform supports both temporary and permanent blocks"**
