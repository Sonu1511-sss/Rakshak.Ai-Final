## 🌐 Features Overview

### 🔐 Authentication System

Rakshak.AI implements a robust role-based authentication system secured using JWT (JSON Web Tokens):

  - **Admin**: Full access to all dashboards, detailed logs, IP control functionalities, and attack simulators.
  - **User**: Limited access primarily to view logs and utilize the attack simulation tools.
  - Secure routing ensures **no unauthorized access** to restricted administrative resources.

### 📊 Admin Dashboard Features

The admin panel provides a comprehensive interface for real-time visibility and control:

  - **Live Stats Panel**: Displays critical metrics such as:
      - Total requests
      - Threats blocked
      - Alerts triggered
      - Countries tracked
      - Anomalies detected
      - Currently blocked IPs
  - **Interactive Graphs (Chart.js)**: Visualizes data trends, including:
      - Weekly traffic patterns
      - Ratio of safe vs. malicious request patterns

### 🌍 Geo-IP Detection & Mapping

Leverages external APIs for comprehensive geographical insights:

  - Integrates with **ip-api.com** and **ipinfo.io** to enrich IP data.
  - Converts each IP address into:
      - Country name & flag emoji
      - Internet Service Provider (ISP) details
      - Geographical coordinates
  - Enables filtering and analysis of traffic by country to identify region-based attacks.

### 📡 Real-Time Traffic Logs

Provides live monitoring of network traffic with updates every 3 seconds:

  - Logs contain detailed information for each request:
      - IP Address
      - Country
      - ISP
      - HTTP Method & URL
      - Time of request
      - Threat detected (if any)
      - Status (Safe, Suspicious, Blocked)
  - **Color-coded Log View** for quick identification:
      - 🟩 Green: Safe
      - 🟨 Yellow: Suspicious
      - 🟥 Red: Blocked (Malicious)

### 💥 Attack Simulation Tools

Built-in tools to simulate common cyberattacks, ideal for learning, testing, and demonstrations:

  - `flood.sh`: Simulates HTTP Flood (DDoS) attacks.
  - `brute-force.sh`: Simulates repeated login attempts.
  - `stuffing.js`: Simulates credential stuffing scenarios.
  - All simulation tools are also accessible directly via the Web UI Simulator tab.

### 🛡️ Real-Time Threat Detection

The backend middleware inspects every incoming request, applying AI-like logic to detect and block threats in real-time:

  - Detects various attack patterns:
      - Brute-force attempts
      - DDoS/flooding attempts
      - Bot headers & other anomalies
  - **IP Blocking**:
      - Automatically blocks identified malicious IPs.
      - Stores blocked IPs persistently in MongoDB.
      - Administrators can manually unblock IPs via the dashboard's control panel.

### 🧭 UI Navigation & Pages

The user interface is built with **React.js** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, featuring role-based routing:

| Path          | Description                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `/login`      | Secure login for Admin & User               |
| `/dashboard`  | Role-based dashboard (Admin/User)           |
| `/logs`       | Real-time traffic logs                      |
| `/alerts`     | View blocked/malicious alerts               |
| `/control`    | Admin control for IP blocking/unblocking    |
| `/simulators` | Trigger test attacks                        |
| `/logout`     | End session securely                        |
